# Java Stream API Practice

A hands-on Java project focused on mastering the **Stream API** through a series of practical coding exercises. Ideal for interviews, sharpening functional programming skills, or deep-diving into Java collections with a modern approach.


## Features

- Stream API practice problems
- Categorized into **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** levels
- Covers filtering, mapping, reducing, collectors usage 
- Each problem includes a `main` method for its easy execution


## Prerequisites & Tech Stack

- **Java 17** (some functions might not work for versions < jdk 17)
- **Maven 3.6** or higher

cd stream-api-practice
```

**Build the project with Maven:**

```bash
mvn clean compile
```


## Purpose

This project is part of my ongoing learning and revision. It serves as a go-to place for:

- Java Stream API interview prep
- Practicing intermediate to advanced stream operations
- Gaining hands-on experience with real-world patterns

## Notes

- No tests are included; verify solutions by running the main method and checking the output.
- Problems are designed for self-study and interview prep.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Preferred contributions include:

- New Stream API problems (with implementations) commonly asked in interviews
- Ensure problems don’t duplicate existing ones
- Follow the project style: one problem per Java file with a `main` method

To contribute:

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your changes
- Submit a Pull Request with a clear description
- [Open issue](https://github.com/sourabhkourav/stream-api-practice/issues/new) for bug or feature request
